# Preet's Portfolio

Welcome to my digital garage — where cybersecurity meets cutting-edge cryptography.

## 🎓 Education

Computer Science & Engineering, B.Tech

## 👨‍💻 Work Experience

Cryptographer @ Qclairvoyance Quantum Labs
- Working on Certifying Authority based on lattice based digital signature schemes
- Integrated Lattice-Based Cryptography in QVPN

## 🚧 Currently Building

I'm actively exploring **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)** and working on various integrations that aim to secure the future before it arrives.

### 🔐 Projects in Progress

- **Post-Quantum Crypto Wallet**  
  A wallet that laughs in the face of quantum computers. Think cold storage, but future-proof.

- **PQ-Tunnel**  
  A secure tunnel that exposes local ports to the internet — **just like ngrok**, but with post-quantum encryption under the hood. No more MITM attacks.

- **Securing IoT with PQC**  
  Bringing strong cryptography to the edge. Writing PQC implementations for low-power devices like the **ESP32**, because your smart devices deserve security.

## 🌱 Hobbies

When I’m not diving into crypto or squeezing code into microcontrollers, I enjoy:

- 📚 **Reading** – Always curious, always learning.  
- 🏊‍♂️ **Swimming** – The best way to clear the cache in my brain.
